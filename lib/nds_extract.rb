  # * source: An Array of Hashes containing director information including

  # RETURN:
  #
  # Array of Hashes containing all of a director's movies. Each movie will need

  # return a Hash that includes the total worldwide_gross of all the movies from
  # each studio.
  #
  # INPUT:
  # * collection: Array of Hashes where each Hash represents a movie
  #
  # RETURN:
  #
  # Hash whose keys are the studio names and whose values are the sum
  # total of all the worldwide_gross numbers for every movie in the input Hash
